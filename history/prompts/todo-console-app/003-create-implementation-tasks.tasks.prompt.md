## Prompt

# sp.tasks
# Project: Todo App (Hackathon II)
# Phase: I – In-Memory Python Console Application
# Tech Stack: Python 3.13+, UV, Claude Code, Spec-Kit Plus
# Rule: No manual coding. All code must be generated by Claude Code via Spec-Kit Plus.

tasks:
  - id: T-001
    title: Project Initialization & Environment Setup
    description: Initialize the Python project using UV, create the required folder structure, and prepare the Storage (MemoryAgent)
  - id: T-002
    title: Define Task Domain Model
    description: Create the in-memory Task data model as defined in the specification
  - id: T-004
    title: Implement Task Business Logic (LogicAgent)
    description: Implement business logic for CRUD operations on tasks

    title: Implement Console User Interface (UIAgent)
    description: Implement a console-based UI for interacting with the todo application
  - id: T-006
    title: Application Orchestration & Entry Point
    description: Wire together UI, logic, and memory modules into a working console application
  - id: T-007
    title: Spec Traceability & Documentation
    description: Ensure all generated code references Task IDs and spec sections

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive task list with:
- 42 executable tasks organized into 9 phases
- Phase 1: Setup (T-001 to T-003) - UV project, linting, tests
- Phase 2: Foundational (T-004 to T-006) - Task model, memory storage, exceptions
- Phase 3-8: User Stories 1-6 with tests and implementation
- Phase 9: Polish - Entry point, help system, coverage, README
- All tasks reference spec sections and have clear acceptance criteria
- Dependencies and execution order documented
- Parallel opportunities identified

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Executable task list ready for implementation
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: specs/001-todo-console-app/tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement or start TDD cycle with /sp.red
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks organized by user story priority (P1→P2→P3), each story independently testable

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
